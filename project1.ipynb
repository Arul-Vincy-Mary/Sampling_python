            "According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the ''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's financial positions. \n",
            "El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context. \n",
            "The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric power plants. \n",
            "At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits. \n",
            "More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. \n",
            "Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. \n",
            "In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering. \n",
            "''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. \n",
            "El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.'' \n",
            "California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant ''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior. \n",
            "The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California. \n",
            "As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in December. \n",
            "To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous. \n",
            "High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter. \n",
            "''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North America. \n",
            "Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents. \n",
            "''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads.'' \n",
            "The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as the agency's public meeting on Wednesday. \n",
            "Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day. \n",
            "Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement. \n",
            "Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative. \n",
            "''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.'' \n",
            "The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso denied the accusation. \n",
            "With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. \n",
            "Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California. \n",
            "In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market,'' the company said. \n",
            "''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas. El Paso is in all those businesses. \n",
            "''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse?'' he said. \n",
            "Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. \n",
            "''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which California has brought its complaint about El Paso. \n",
            "To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market capitalization of $32 billion. \n",
            "At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is expected to earn about $1.4 billion. \n",
            "El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, particularly in the Western United States.'' \n",
            "Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the bid. \n",
            "The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including ''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk. \n",
            "For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. \n",
            "Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.'' \n",
            "On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.'' \n",
            "The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread. \n",
            "In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market. \n",
            "Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices. \n",
            "The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.'' \n",
            "About This Report \n",
            "This article and others on California's energy problems are part of a joint effort with the PBS series ''Frontline'' that will result in a documentary later this year.\n",

            "\n",
            "I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum.  Mr. Cooper indicated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d. \n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.\n",
            "\n",
            "I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such delivery point capacity available to its shippers.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the case, then \"he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations\" with both SoCal Gas and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions that \"end game\" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other big marketing companies (in his words, \"such as ENA\") for Needles capacity, then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a prime example.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental Needles capacity, and asked that I formally \"run it up the flagpole\" to senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's \"official position.\"   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily take \"no\" or even a \"maybe\" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any other customer.\n",
